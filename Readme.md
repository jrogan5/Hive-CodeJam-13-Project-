To run on two computers, 

1. open send.py on "client" computer and "listening.py" on "server" computer. 

2. make sure paths for files being sent and directory for files being recieved are good.

  3 cases: 
  - client request manifest.txt from server
  - client request hash.zip from server
  - client send hash.zp to server

--> py listening.py on the "server" computer

--> py send.py on the "client" computer
